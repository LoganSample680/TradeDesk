// @ts-check
// ── The drive we already timed, now measured ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Owner direction (2026-08-01): "when we go geocode to geocode it calls MapKit
// to compute the mileage then we just rely on MapKit's calculations", and the
// attribution rule alongside it: "it either has to be in a company vehicle for
// an employee, or the owner can log things on any personal vehicle."
//
// Before this, the geofence knew the truck left the shop at 7:12 and reached the
// Miller job at 7:38, and threw the distance away. Miles only existed where a
// person typed them, or where End Drive guessed them at elapsed time x 25mph.
//
// What these tests pin down:
//   • Every leg type produces a trip, from both endpoints' GEOCODES, never from
//     a raw GPS fix. A fix inside a 600ft fence can sit 600ft off the address,
//     and an audit a year later has to reproduce the same number.
//   • The vehicle rule, in both directions. An employee in their own car is
//     still PAID for the drive (time logs) but the company does not deduct the
//     miles. The owner is the business, so any vehicle counts.
//   • A commute never becomes a business trip. The GPS cannot tell home from a
//     job site and will happily hand us that leg.
//   • One leg is one trip, forever. The leg key is shared with the time entry,
//     so a replay cannot bill the same miles twice.
//   • Arriving with no signal does not lose the trip. That is the normal case
//     on a rural site, not an edge case.

  // owners with a home office the drive from home office to a shop is work
  // related, same with home to a shop or home to supply and back."
  //
  // They were right, and the app had been LYING about it. Settings has a home
  // office checkbox, and three separate screens promise what ticking it does:
  // mileage.js ("your drives from home to job sites count as deductible
  // business miles") and tax.js twice ("every drive from home to a job site
  // counts as business mileage, not commuting"). Nothing read S.homeOffice.
  // Ticking it changed the wording and logged exactly zero additional miles.
  //
  // The line these tests hold: without a declared home office the first drive
  // out of the house is a commute and is refused, because the GPS cannot tell
  // "home" from "business location" and guessing in the contractor's favour is
  // the app inflating a deduction for them. WITH one declared, the residence is
  // a business location and every drive out of it counts (Rev. Rul. 99-7). The
  // declaration is the contractor's to make and theirs to defend. Ours is to
